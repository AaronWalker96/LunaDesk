# LunaDesk

### What is LunaDesk?

LunaDesk is a web app created by Josh Cawthorne for the Supabase Hackathon.

The concept of the app is for companies to be able to sign-up, and enable employees to share which days they're working in the office, and which days they're working from home, to allow better planning on when teams should be in the office.

### LET ME AT IT!
You're eager! A link to a live version is available here: https://lunadesk.netlify.app/, though perhaps you'd like to finish reading this readme first? Or don't, I'm not your boss.

### How did you build LunaDesk?

This project was created using **NextJS** with **Supabase Auth, Storage and Database**. It also utilises libraries including (but not limited to) Framer Motion, easy-peasy, styled-components and recharts.

### How does LunaDesk use Supabase?

As stated above, this project uses quite a few features of Supabase. It uses Auth to allow users to both sign-up and login using either an email address, Google account or Apple account. It uses Supabase's databases to store all data, and uses storage to store avatars for companies.

### How can I run LunaDesk on my local machine

To run the project, all you need to do is download the project to your local machine, followed by running `npm i` to install the required packages, and then `npm run-script dev` to boot it up. **Please note:** an `.env.local` file is required in the following structure to run locally:

```
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[your_url]
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your_key]
BASE_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000/
```

For your convencience, you can use this handy Netlify site to view the project live instead. Nifty, huh?

Alternatively, feel free to reach out to me via email (joshcawthorne97@gmail.com), and I'd be happy to provide you with the required keys to hook it up to the existing database, plus my banking details should you have any large sums of money from a recently deceased distant relative I've never heard of.

### It isn't finished?!

No ðŸ˜”  

Like all great visionaries, I bit off more than I could chew. I do plan to keep working on it though...
